# Web Framework (Flask)

This directory contains all tasks regarding the 0x04 project of the \
Holberton School Foundations programme - AirBnB clone. In this project \
we replicate a simple version of the AirBnB website.

This project creates the web framework for this website, which is hosted \
by us. The goal is to go through all the steps of building a functional \
website with the following parts:
## Server side (back-end):
- Console (made with python)
- Storage engines (MySQL and JSON)
- Web Framework (Flask)
- RESTful API (Flask)

## Client side (front-end):
- Static HTML
- Dynamic HTML + JavaScript
